## Sample Interview Questions

### Question 1: Subarray Maximum Range
Given an unsorted array, find the subarray range in which each element is maximum.

Example:
```
Input: [5,4,1,6,8,2]
Output:
5 -> (0,2)
4 -> (1,2)
1 -> (2,2)
6 -> (0,3)
8 -> (0,5)
2 -> (5,5)
```

### Question 2: Word Search in Grid
Find words in a 2D grid where consecutive letters can be either immediately below or to the right of the previous letter.

### Question 3: Binary Search Tree Trimming
Trim a BST so that all its elements lie in [low, high] range while maintaining the relative structure.

### Question 4: Canonical Path
Simplify an absolute Unix-style file path by handling '.', '..', and multiple slashes.
