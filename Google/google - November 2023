He directly jumped into questions without intro.Asked me to open a doc and shared a question over there
Q. You need to insert a range of element in DS and search a point within that range.
First Approach:- Using HashMap
He interrupted and said "Say you are using list then how would you write it?"

I wrote structure of class and functions
Sugesstion he gave on the go:
->Name class properly Pairs not Pair
->return in query
->Initialisation in constructor

Iterative approach and time complexity we discussed
Then  he asked to optimize.So I came up with binary Search a point in list of pairs. WIth that we need sorting of list.
